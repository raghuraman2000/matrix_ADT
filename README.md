# Contents
This repositry contains five header files: <br>
**matrices.h <br>
matrix.h <br>
sqr_matrix.h <br>
COO.h <br>
CSR.h** <br>
along with one **demo.cpp** file for demonstration purposes,
and one **input.txt** file to go along with the demonstration.
# Usage
To use all the matrix ADTs, make sure that the include directory is in the present working directory. 
It is enough to include **matrices.h** wherever the ADT is required.
Use the command **make** to compile all .cpp files and **make clean** to remove all binaries after working.
